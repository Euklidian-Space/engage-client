About this project
In 2015, Feeding America reported that 1.5 million people in Los Angeles County lack sufficient funds to buy food, making it home to the US’s largest population of individuals affected by Food Insecurity. Today, there are hundreds of efforts – spanning the non-profit, community-based, governmental, educational and for-profit sectors – that are currently planning and implementing solutions for Food Insecurity in Los Angeles.

Food Oasis Los Angeles (FOLA) is creating a web/mobile platform to visualize the complex landscape of these often disparate solutions on one map.

Support this project!
We’re a volunteer-based project and would love your donation! On the donation page, please choose Los Angeles Brigade and make it in honor of Food Oasis LA with the email address info@foodoasis.la

DONATE

FOLA’s platform is intended for use by:
Food seekers
LA community members affected by food insecurity and those interested in finding healthy food sources.
FOLA is working to unify, process and create datasets that map the range of available Food resources. Customize which datasets are shown so you can see solutions that align with your personal preferences and needs

Advocates
Government staff, non-profit organizations and community members
Find existing solutions along with “Food Deserts” and outcomes like health metrics and poverty rates. Take advantage of the visual information to fight Food Insecurity in your communities.

Volunteers
Concerned citizens who want to get involved
Many Angelenos – those affected by Food Insecurity and those not – are asking: How can I help? FOLA’s platform aims to connect concerned individuals with opportunities to volunteer, donate and get involved in Food Security activism.

Our Mission
To build a unified hub for Angelenos to easily find healthy food.
